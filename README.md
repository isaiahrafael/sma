### 2. Create a New Branch Before Making Changes

Before modifying anything, create a new branch based on `main` using your name. This ensures your changes remain separate from the main code.

#### Using the Terminal

After cloning, navigate to the repository folder and run:

```sh
git checkout -b your-name
```

(Replace `your-name` with your actual name or a meaningful branch name.)

#### Using Visual Studio Code

1. **Open Source Control** (click the Git icon in the left sidebar).
2. Click on the current branch name in the bottom-left corner.
3. Select **"Create new branch"**.
4. Enter your branch name (e.g., your name) and press **Enter**.

### 3. Push Your Branch (If You Want to Share Your Changes)

Once you have made changes, commit them and push your branch to the remote repository.

#### Using the Terminal

```sh
git add .
git commit -m "Your commit message"
git push origin your-name
```

(Replace `your-name` with your branch name.)

Now, your changes are safely stored on your own branch and wonâ€™t affect the `main` branch unless merged.
