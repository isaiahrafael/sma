# Simulation Modelling Analysis

## If you're reading this, it's too late.

Anyway, this Git repo will contain most, if not all, SMA HW code.  
Also, if I shared this with you, it probably means that you helped me one way or another, or I'm just bored.

Take note of updates via the **'LAST COMMIT MESSAGE'** column to see whether I modified anything.  
Feel free to clone this repo, but please use it at your discretion. If your HW is wrong, we're wrong.
