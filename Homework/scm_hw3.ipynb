    "\n",
    "Therefore, I used Python to:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Generate random demand** for each class using a normal distribution with the given mean and standard deviation.  \n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Progressively allocate capacity** starting from the lowest fare class (Class 4) up to the highest (Class 1), following EMSR-b logic and using pre-calculated booking limits.  \n",
    "3. **Calculate total revenue** from each simulation run based on how many seats were sold in each class and their respective fares.  \n",
    "4. **Repeat the simulation 100,000 times** to capture demand variability and get a realistic average revenue.  \n",
    "5. **Compute the expected revenue** by averaging the results across all runs.\n",
    "\n",
    "This helped me understand that EMSR-b doesn’t just use average demand — it accounts for uncertainty and makes smarter capacity protection decisions. Running the simulation showed how demand variability affects revenue, and why fixed averages alone can be misleading.\n"

    "### Why the Expected Revenue is $322,961.44\n",
    "\n",
    "The value **$322,961.44** is the result of simulating 100,000 possible demand scenarios using the EMSR-b booking limits.\n",
    "\n",
    "Instead of assuming that demand is fixed and equal to the mean (like in a basic revenue calculation), the simulation treats demand as **random**, following a **normal distribution** with a given mean and standard deviation for each fare class.\n",
    "\n",
    "Each run:\n",
    "- Generates a different random demand outcome.\n",
    "- Allocates available capacity starting from the lowest fare class (Class 4) to the highest (Class 1), respecting both the booking limits and remaining seats.\n",
    "- Computes revenue based on how many seats are sold in each class.\n",
    "\n",
    "By repeating this process 100,000 times and averaging the total revenue from all runs, we get a more **realistic estimate** of expected revenue when demand is uncertain.\n",
    "\n",
    "The result — **$322,961.44** — reflects the fact that, due to variability in demand, we don't always fill all the booking limits, especially for higher-paying classes. It’s lower than the revenue calculated using just average demand (which was $335,700), because in real life, demand doesn’t always reach the mean.\n",
    "\n",
    "This shows how EMSR-b accounts for **risk and uncertainty**, and why simulating is important when evaluating performance.\n"
